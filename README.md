# README for LLM Detection using BERT

## Overview
This project aims to detect if an essay is generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art language processing model. The provided Python script involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch
- Google Colab (for training environment)

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading
The script starts by importing necessary libraries and then loads the training and testing datasets from CSV files.

### 2. Data Exploration
A brief exploration of the training data is conducted using `.describe()` to understand the dataset's basic statistical properties.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
The `preprocess_text` function is defined to clean the text data. It involves removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, tokenizing, and removing stopwords.

### 4. Text Preprocessing Application
The preprocessing function is applied to the 'text' column of the training data.

### 5. Data Splitting
The training data is split into training and validation sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

### 6. BERT Tokenizer
The BERT tokenizer is set up to encode the texts. This process converts texts into a format that can be used by the BERT model.

### 7. Data Encoding
The text data (both training and validation) is encoded using the BERT tokenizer.

### 8. Google Drive Mounting
The script includes a command to mount Google Drive, which is necessary for saving or loading data in Google Colab.

### 9. Dataset Preparation for PyTorch
The encoded texts and labels are converted into TensorDataset, a PyTorch dataset format.

### 10. DataLoader Setup
DataLoaders for training and validation datasets are created to load data in batches.

### 11. BERT Model Initialization
The BERT model for sequence classification is initialized and moved to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).

### 12. Optimizer Configuration
The AdamW optimizer is configured with the BERT model parameters and a learning rate.

### 13. Model Training
A `train_model` function is defined and called to train the model on the training dataset. It involves forward and backward propagation with gradient clipping.

### 14. Model Evaluation
The `evaluate_model` function is used to evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset using accuracy as the metric.

### 15. Prediction on Test Data
The script encodes the test data and creates a DataLoader. A `predict_test_data` function generates predictions on the test data.

### 16. Submission File Creation
Finally, a DataFrame containing predictions is created and saved as a CSV file, ready for submission.

## Usage
The script is intended to run in a Jupyter notebook environment, preferably Google Colab for better performance. Make sure to adjust file paths for loading and saving data according to your setup.

## Note
Before running the script, ensure that all required libraries are installed and that you have access to the necessary computational resources, particularly if you plan to use a GPU.
